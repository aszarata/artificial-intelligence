# Neural Network
This repository encompasses custom neural network code implementing backpropagation learning, along with evaluations on the following datasets:

1. [Adult Census Dataset]
2. [MNIST Dataset]

The neural network is exclusively built using the NumPy library.

Key features of the model include:

- Dropout
- Mini-batch Learning
- Early Stopping
- Batch Normalization
